### What I learned

This challenge helped me understand better the background image and multiple background images CSS properties, however I struggle with all the features it has, and couldn't find a way to use its short hand.

Also I have been using sass with npm or with the vscode extension for sass, however in vscode any time I save, it pops up the output console and it's anoying, so I prefer the traditional way within the terminal but this time I installed sass locally not with npm but with homebrew package manager, it took me a while to set up everything but from now will be easier to start a new challenge.
